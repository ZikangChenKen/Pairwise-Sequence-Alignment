# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment
This repo focuses on computing the optimal score for pairwise sequence alignment, not on the alignment itself. Though a biologist is ultimately interested in seeing the alignment, there are many applications where the score alone is of interest. For example, in multiple sequence alignment, the most commonly used approach is called progressive alignment, where an evolutionary tree is Ô¨Årst built based on the scores of pairwise alignments, and then the tree is used as a guide for doing the multiple sequence alignment. In this case, the pairwise alignments are performed solely for the sake of obtaining scores, and the alignments themselves are not needed.
